 The analysis of user sentiment in reviews has become a cor
nerstone for businesses aiming to understand customer pref
erences and improve their services.
 Platforms like Amazon receive millions of user-generated
 reviews, providing valuable insight into customer satisfac
tion, product quality, and overall brand perception. How
ever, the sentiment in reviews is dynamic and changes over
 time due to product updates, changes in consumer expec
tations, external events, and evolving trends. Understanding
 how sentiment evolves can help businesses respond proac
tively to customer concerns, improve product offerings, and
 refine marketing strategies.
 Sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language process
ing (NLP), enables the extraction and quantification of emo
tions from textual data. While traditional sentiment analysis
 methods focus on static review snapshots, analyzing senti
ment as a time series presents new challenges and oppor
tunities. A product that initially receives positive feedback
 may later see a decline in sentiment due to emerging com
petition or quality issues. Conversely, customer sentiment
 may improve following a successful update or a favorable
 change in pricing. Understanding these temporal shifts pro
vide valuable insights beyond a simple snapshot of customer
 opinions.
 Time series modeling techniques, such as ARIMA, LSTMs,
 and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), allow for the detec
tion of trends, detect anomalies, identification of seasonal
 patterns, and forecasting of future sentiment shifts.
